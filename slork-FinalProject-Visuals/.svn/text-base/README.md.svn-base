CS 248 SFML Template
====================

This is a template for writing rendering programs using the [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org) and the [Open Asset Import Library](http://assimp.sourceforge.net).

Building and Running the Demo
-----------------------------

### Linux (Ubuntu or similar)

1. Install [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net) (Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev)
2. make
3. make run

### OS X

1. Open the XCode template in the "xcode" folder
2. Run from the menu

### Windows

1. Open the Visual Studio project in the "vs2010" folder
2. Run from the menu

Note: On Windows, the asset importer is really slow in debug mode.  Switch to release mode, and the importer is much faster.


Included Files
--------------

There are is a sample Phong shader in the "shaders" folder, and some sample models in the "models" folder.  You can find a basic demo in Main.cpp, and a class for loading shaders in Shader.cpp/Shader.h.
